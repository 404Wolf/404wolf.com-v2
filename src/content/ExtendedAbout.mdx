Hi! I'm Wolf. I'm a CS major at [Case Western](https://case.edu/), a two time
alum of [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/)'s self-driven programming
retreat, and a [Bard HS Early College](https://bhsec.bard.edu/queens/) grad.
Currently I'm interning as a fullstack/systems engineer at
[Val Town](https://val.town), a serverless deployment platform where we make it
easy and fun to instantly ship Typescript functions to the internet, where most
recently I've been working on bringing the Deno language server to our web
editor, on a Pingora/rust k8s load balancer, and
[on building our CLI](https://github.com/val-town/vt).

I've always loved learning new tools and frameworks, and my fullstack interests
have always come naturally. I love constantly learning of new ways to solve
problems. Last summer, I did a programming retreat at
[Recurse Center](https://recurse.com), where I learned Nix(OS), bash, a lot of
CLI tooling, and spent time working on an
[Android-in-the-browser project](https://404wolf.com/posts/project/androidBrowser)
to stream Nix-containerized Android emulators to the browser over WebRTC. In my
senior year of high school, I did my first Recurse batch, developing this
website and on a flashcard generator tool. At Case, I recently completed the
[Veale Snyder fellowship](https://case.edu/entrepreneurship/fellowships/veale-snyder-fellows-program),
I'm a member of the SEC allocations committee (which disburses funds to clubs),
am vice president of Linux club, and president of board game club. Last year I
worked on a robot that sorts coins by date with a student project grant from our
Makerspace, focusing on CAD and building the robot, which I've started to work
on a Django backend to process coin images for. And, in Freshman year I won my
school's hackathon with two friends, with
[a project](https://404wolf.com/posts/project/freeCwruFood) that uses a fine
tuned OpenAI model to scan all events on campus and find those with free food.

This site was born from my desire to document and showcase my various eclectic
projects and findings. For many pages, they will continue to be updated as the
projects and discoveries themselves evolve. Please also feel free to check out
my [about page](/about) to learn more about me, and also see my
[resume](/resume). Technical questions, personal questions, or random questions.
I love chatting tech, so if you're interested in any of my work, or have any
questions at all, please feel free to reach out to any of the above contacts,
and I'll try to get back as soon as possible!
