Greetings! I'm Wolf, a CS student at Case Western with a passion for creating
and using developer tooling, particularly at its intersection with webdev. 

Most recently, I have been interning at Val Town, a fun and flexible serverless
JS functions (FASS) platform. Before that, I completed a batch at Recurse
Center, a NYC based self-driven programming retreat.

I'm currently looking for a full-time role starting in \~May 2025. I'm most
interested in building tools for developers, ideally with some engineering
emphasis on lower-level networking and linux, where I get to learn a lot of new
modern tooling. Right now I love go, rust, typescript, and nix, but I'm open!
I'm most available via email at [wolf@404wolf.com](mailto:wolf@404wolf.com).

The problems I find most interesting are generally devx ones; build systems,
CLIs, Devops -- I enjoy reducing developer friction. I'm also interested in
fullstack, particularly projects that serve unique and uncommon purposes, or do
things in unconventional ways, and generally with emphasis on networking and
infra. I'm a big fan of Nix, and enjoy reproducibility, declarative-ness, and
developer ergonomics.
