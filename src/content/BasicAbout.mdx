Hi! I'm Wolf. I'm a **CWRU** student with a passion for developer tooling,
coding and hacking, a love of strategy board games, and overall enjoyer of
creating, designing, engineering, geeking, making, and figuring things out.

Information, projects, contacts, my resume, and more can be found on this
website. If you have any questions, feel free to [email](mailto:wolf@404wolf.com)!
