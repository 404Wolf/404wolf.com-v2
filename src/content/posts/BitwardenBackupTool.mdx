  Bitwarden, a popular open source and free password manager, does a great job of securely storing passwords and other personal data in their cloud, well-encrypted and accessible. However, their option to export your vault (to maintain a local/physical backup) is to export it as a .json file, leaving data in a very human-unfriendly format. So, I made a program that converts the json to a more human readable html file, which one can print onto physical paper. In addition, I've integrated automatic favicon/icon fetching, QR code generation, databreach checks and more.

# Bitwarden Backup Human-izer

## A program to convert a bitwarden json backup into sleek html

### How to use:

1. Get the [official bitwarden desktop app](https://bitwarden.com/download/), in
   order to export your vault as a json file
2. Open the bitwarden desktop app, and click `file > export vault`, making sure
   to choose `json` as the format.
3. Once you reenter your master password, choose to download the json export in
   the same file directory as this project's `main.py`, and rename the export to
   `export.json`. You should be left with an **unencrypted** json file. When you
   are finished, you will want to delete this file and empty your trash.
4. Open console, and run `main.py` by entering `python main.py`, or
   `python3 main.py`, depending on your operating system. If you get a
   `ModuleNotFound` error, type
   `pip install <name of module that was not found>`. Depending on how many
   items are in your vault, this process can take a considerable amount of time
   (sometimes minutes).
5. Open `output.html` in a web browser such as
   [chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/), and print out the file, or save it
   as a pdf by clicking the `save as pdf` option under `printers`.
6. Delete the `qrCodes` folder, `output.html` file, and `export.json` file when
   you are done, and **empty your trash**! If you use a utility such as google
   drive backup and sync, do not put these files in a folder that syncs. These
   files contain unencrypted sensitive data.

### Use cases:

- Printing out the backup
- Storing as a backup on a hard drive, in case bitwarden ever goes away in the
  future
- Having access to your vault without needing a device

### Future plans:

- TOTP 2FA QR code generation
- Folder support (colour coding, or small tab on right side to indicate folder
  name)
- Credit card image generation (for credit card type items, generate a picture
  of a credit card with the user's info on it)
- Automatic html to pdf conversion
- Mark/save where the user has printed up to, so they can only print new content
- Decrypt encrypted bitwarden json backups
- Fix inaccurate/broken progress bar

### Trying it out:

If you just want to try out the script, you can find an example `export.json`
and `output.html` file
