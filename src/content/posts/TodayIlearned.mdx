If I have a unit struct like:

```rust
struct UnitStruct;

impl UnitStruct {
	pub fn say_hi(&self) -> 'static &str {
		"Hi!"
	}
}
```

Then

```rust
UnitStruct.say_hi() // implicitly creates an instance
```

Will automatically create a new one and run the method!

Bash has two types of heredocs!

Regular heredoc (what you know and love):
```bash
cat << EOF
Hello $USER
Your home directory is $HOME
EOF
```

Quoted heredoc (variables are NOT expanded, treated literally as a big chunk of string with literal $s in it):
```bash
cat << 'EOF'
Hello $USER
Your home directory is $HOME
EOF
```

You can also use `<<-` instead of `<<` to strip leading tabs from the heredoc content 🤯:
```bash
if true; then
    cat <<- EOF
 This line is indented with a tab
 So is this one
 But the tabs will be stripped from the output
 EOF
fi
```

The difference is that quoting the delimiter (`'EOF'`) prevents variable expansion.

Learned about the "Dreadful Diamond on Derivation" problem...

[Full credit to this stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21558/in-c-what-is-a-virtual-base-class)

Basically, you have an inheritance hierarchy that looks like

```
  A
 / \
B   C
 \ /
  D
```

The issue is that if we do `A.D()`, we could be referring to `A::B.D()` or
`A::C.D()`.

So you can do `class A : public virtual B, public C{…)` to only inherit the
actual methods from `C` to solve this problem.

I set up [neotest](https://github.com/nvim-neotest/neotest) and
[nvim-dap](https://github.com/mfussenegger/nvim-dap) and then removed them from
my config. Turns out I prefer `vscode` once I'm debugging/testing.

Some `vscode` shortcuts:

- `control+1` focus the text editor group
- `control+shift+e` toggle focus of the file tree and text editor group
- "control+\`" focus the terminal, and then toggle it

You can use `git mv <from> <to>` and `git rm [-r] <thing>` to move and delete
things with `git` without consequences if you have things like submodules.

Bash variable parameter extraction + glob stuff

- `${VARIABLE}%ff` removes the first occurrence of `ff` from the back of
  `VARIABLE`
- `${VARIABLE}#ff` removes the first occurrence of `ff` from the front of
  `VARIABLE`
- `${variable//pattern/replacement}` is a form of parameter expansion that
  replaces all occurrences of pattern with replacement in the value of variable

In `bash` you can use `**` to get a list of files in the current directory. You
can even pattern match with like `**.nix`

So, like

```bash
for file in **; do
    echo $file
done
```

And `file` is the relative path of the file from where you run the command.

`css` has a `not` function to target things that are not the thing. So like,
`p:not(.foobar #barbar)` will target everything that is not of class `foobar`
and with id `barbar`.

[Powershell](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell) is open source. You can
use Powershell as your default Linux shell. Who knew.

Also, Windows has a cool app called "Sandbox," which you can create `xml` config
files to template, that are basically Windows virtual machines without bloat
(not even the microsoft store). They work really well, I think they should be a
distribution of Windows itself.

- [You can terminate a unified AST traversal early, or skip the iteration early, by returning special things](https://unifiedjs.com/explore/package/unist-util-visit-parents/#what-is-this).
  If you return `false` the iteration ends. If you return 'skip' then it skips
  the iteration right away (kinda like `continue` if it were a loop or walker
  iterator).

Used this to create this script to yoink a specific section from a markdown
string (for example, I want to get the # Description section's paragraphs only)

```ts
export function getContentOfSection(
  markdown: string,
  header: string,
  depth: number = 1,
) {
  const ast = unified().use(remarkParse).parse(markdown)

  const output: string[] = []
  let inHeadersSection = false
  let nextIsWantedText = false
  visit(ast, (node) => {
    if (
      node.type === 'heading' &&
      node.depth === depth &&
      node.children.length > 0 &&
      node.children[0].type === 'text' &&
      node.children[0].value === header
    )
      inHeadersSection = true
    if (inHeadersSection) {
      if (nextIsWantedText) {
        if (node.type === 'text') output.push(node.value)
        else if (node.type !== 'paragraph') return false
      }
      if (node.type === 'paragraph') nextIsWantedText = true
    }
  })
  return output.join('\n')
}
```

Going to try to be more consistent with this again!

```ts
console.trace('How did we get here?')
```

Will do a `console.log` and also spit out a stack trace
