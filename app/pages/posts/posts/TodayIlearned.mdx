# Today I Learned

A collection of random disconnected things that I learn on given days.

# 2024-11-20

Learned about the "Dreadful Diamond on Derivation" problem...

[Full credit to this stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21558/in-c-what-is-a-virtual-base-class)

Basically, you have an inheritance hierarchy that looks like

```
  A
 / \
B   C
 \ /
  D
```

The issue is that if we do `A.D()`, we could be referring to `A::B.D()` or `A::C.D()`.

So you can do `class A : public virtual B, public C{…)` to only inherit the actual methods from `C` to solve this problem.

I set up [neotest](https://github.com/nvim-neotest/neotest) and [nvim-dap](https://github.com/mfussenegger/nvim-dap) and then removed them from my config. Turns out I prefer `vscode` once I'm debugging/testing.

Some `vscode` shortcuts:

* `control+1` focus the text editor group
* `control+shift+e` toggle focus of the file tree and text editor group
* "control+\`" focus the terminal, and then toggle it

> In [information theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_theory "Information theory"), [linguistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistics "Linguistics"), and [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science "Computer science"), the **Levenshtein distance** is a [string metric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_metric "String metric") for measuring the difference between two sequences. The Levenshtein distance between two words is the minimum number of single-character edits (insertions, deletions or substitutions) required to change one word into the other. It is named after Soviet mathematician [Vladimir Levenshtein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Levenshtein "Vladimir Levenshtein"), who defined the metric in 1965.[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance#cite_note-1)

You can use `git mv <from> <to>` and `git rm [-r] <thing>` to move and delete things with `git` without consequences if you have things like submodules.

Make `dunst` go to the top right
`origin = "top-right";`
`offset = "10x10";`

Bash variable parameter extraction + glob stuff

* `${VARIABLE}%ff` removes the first occurrence of `ff` from the back of `VARIABLE`
* `${VARIABLE}#ff` removes the first occurrence of `ff` from the front of `VARIABLE`
* `${variable//pattern/replacement}` is a form of parameter expansion that replaces all occurrences of pattern with replacement in the value of variable

In `bash` you can use `**` to get a list of files in the current directory. You can even pattern match with like `**.nix`

So, like

```bash
for file in **; do
    echo $file
done
```

And `file` is the relative path of the file from where you run the command.

`css` has a `not` function to target things that are not the thing. So like, `p:not(.foobar #barbar)` will target everything that is not of class `foobar` and with id `barbar`.

Capital `W` and capital `B` take you forward and backward a word in vim without regard for periods

[Powershell](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell) is open source. You can use Powershell as your default Linux shell. Who knew.

Also, Windows has a cool app called "Sandbox," which you can create `xml` config files to template, that are basically Windows virtual machines without bloat (not even the microsoft store). They work really well, I think they should be a distribution of Windows itself.

* [You can terminate a unified AST traversal early, or skip the iteration early, by returning special things](https://unifiedjs.com/explore/package/unist-util-visit-parents/#what-is-this). If you return `false` the iteration ends. If you return 'skip' then it skips the iteration right away (kinda like `continue` if it were a loop or walker iterator).

Used this to create this script to yoink a specific section from a markdown string (for example, I want to get the # Description section's paragraphs only)

```ts
export function getContentOfSection(
  markdown: string,
  header: string,
  depth: number = 1
) {
  const ast = unified()
    .use(remarkParse)
    .parse(markdown);

  const output: string[] = [];
  let inHeadersSection = false;
  let nextIsWantedText = false;
  visit(ast, node => {
    if (
      node.type === "heading" &&
      node.depth === depth &&
      node.children.length > 0 &&
      node.children[0].type === "text" &&
      node.children[0].value === header
    )
      inHeadersSection = true;
    if (inHeadersSection) {
      if (nextIsWantedText) {
        if (node.type === "text") output.push(node.value);
        else if (node.type !== "paragraph") return false;
      }
      if (node.type === "paragraph") nextIsWantedText = true;
    }
  });
  return output.join("\n");
}
```

Going to try to be more consistent with this again!

```ts
console.trace("How did we get here?")
```

Will do a `console.log` and also spit out a stack trace
